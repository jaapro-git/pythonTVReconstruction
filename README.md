# Total Variation Tomography Reconstruction with Python
This is a Python reimplementation of an algorithm for Total Variation Regularisation of tomography images. The algorithm was originally implemented in Matlab by Samuli Siltanen (University of Helsinki, Finland) based on the work of Kristian Bredies (University of Graz, Austria).

The algorithm reconstructs images from sinogram data and a measurement matrix. The algorithm currently also supports setting the regularisation parameter alpha and the number of iterations for reconstructing the image.
